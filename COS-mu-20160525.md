# GUI Containers & Native docker
## Native docker
### Overview
- OSX - YMMV
- Tool bar interface
- [xhyve](https://github.com/mist64/xhyve)
   - Lightweight virtualization (replaces virtualbox)
   - OSX port of FreeBSD's [bhyve](http://bhyve.org/)
   - Requires OSX 10.10 (Yosemite)

#### Troubleshooting
- logging
   - ```syslog -k Sender Docker``` Basically grep'ing Docker from the logs
   - Logging tool Console app in /Applications/Utilities
      - Open system.log and search for Docker
- Running both on the same system
   - remove the DOCKER environment variables - ```eval $(docker env -u)```

## GUI Containers
Concept - running tools on a machine without having to install them locally. Also, having multiple accounts open to the same site (twitter) at the same time.

### Additional tools required (OS/X)
- [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/) - XServer for OS/X
- [socat](http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/) - socket interface between Docker and XQuartz


### Containers
- Firefox Kiosk mode ```docker run -e DISPLAY=192.168.99.1:0 --name ff-flowdock palemtnrider/dff:0.1.0```
- Chrome ```docker run --name presentation --privileged -e DISPLAY=192.168.99.1:0 palemtnrider/dc:0.1.0```
- Electron Flowdock ```docker run --name electron-fd --security-opt seccomp:unconfined -e DISPLAY=192.168.99.1:0 palemtnrider/electron-fd:0.1.0```

### Issues
- Cut & Paste - probably tied more to Xquartz and not Docker
- Network performance can be spotty
- Regarding electron - not all sites behave (Flowdock SSO)
- errors in the console
- fairly large images (required to run browser)

# Best practices
- Don't use loopback storage in production - performance Issues
- In Dockerfiles - use && instead of ; in RUN commands
   - this can cause failures to be skipped
- Single process per container
   - we were using superviosrd - masked failures (supervisord was still running :) )
- Start using alpine as your base os as the official Docker images are moving this way
- Be aware of your storage drivers
   - turns out RPM install of apache in a CentOS container on an ubuntu 14.04 docker host doesn't work due to aufs fallback is device mapper or newer version of aufs
- ordering in Dockerfile is important to reduce build time
